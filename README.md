# t3-contracts

T3 represents a perpetual, gated decentralized exchange (DEX) system. It is developed as a fork of the GMX DEX, enhanced by incorporating advanced features. One of the key additional features is the integration of the Molecule protocol, which establishes a compliance framework. Access to the T3 DEX is exclusively available to users who meet the compliance requirements set forth by the Molecule protocol and T3 APP

### Molecule Integrations 

This provides a technical overview of the integration of the Molecule Controller contract within the T3 system, highlighting its critical role in access management and protocol compliance. The integration's primary focus is embedded within three key contracts of the T3 system: Router, GLP Manager, and OrderBook.

- System-Wide Implementation: The Molecule Controller contract is integrated into the T3 system, primarily focusing on the Router, GLP Manager, and OrderBook contracts. This integration is pivotal for regulating user access and ensuring adherence to predefined protocols.

- Functionality and Scope: The inclusion of the Molecule Controller Contract in these specific contracts is fundamental for maintaining a robust access control mechanism and ensuring consistent protocol compliance across the platform.

- Core Access Control Functions: Each contract (Router, GLP Manager, and OrderBook) incorporates a setMoleculeController function. This function serves as a critical component in controlling user access and maintaining the integrity and security of the T3 system.

- Role of setMoleculeController: This function is integral in gating the T3 system. It ensures that only users who meet the Molecule Protocol's standards have the ability to interact with the core functionalities of the system.

- Compliance Parameters: The system's compliance parameters are defined based on the Chainalysis sanction list and an Access list. The Access list is formulated based on user sign-up activities, ensuring a robust compliance framework.

- User Interaction and Compliance: Only users who are not flagged on the Chainalysis sanction list and are verified through the sign-up process are granted access to the T3 systemâ€™s core operations. These operations encompass a range of activities including the creation of long/short positions, execution of swaps, and management of liquidity (both addition and removal).
